Jenkins Devops Pipelines for Unity Games

Unity Version: 2021.1.16f1
Jenkins Version: 2.289.3

### NothingGame
NothingGame is a Unity Game with nothing in it. The game that does nothing! I just use it as a placeholder in my devops pipeline for Unity Games. 

### Steps
1. Create a sytem environment variable 'unity_nothing_game' (no quotation marks) that points to your Unity installation. Mine is ``C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2021.1.16f1\Editor``
